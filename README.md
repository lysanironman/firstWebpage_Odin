# firstWebpage_Odin
This is the first attempt at following TOP Curriculum to Build a Web Page. 
Edit: I have built other web pages in the past, but it has been with the use of designing tools and easy-t0-follow templates. Furthermore, I believer it is also important to mention that I have also began to manipulate other web page Source Codes in order to better understand how they work from the inside out!
